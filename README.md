> A lightweight and user-friendly Arduino library for interfacing with the [LTC2959](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2959.html), a versatile power monitor and Coulomb counter IC by Analog Devices.


## 🔍 Overview

The **LTC2959** library allows Arduino and compatible boards to communicate with the LTC2959 over I2C. It supports:

- Voltage monitoring (up to 62.6 V)
- Current monitoring (via sense resistor)
- Temperature monitoring (internal sensor)
- Charge accumulation (mAh)
- Min/Max tracking for voltage and current
- Coulomb counter enable/disable
- Manual charge counter reset

This library abstracts low-level register access and handles scaling, conversions, and two’s complement math for you.


## ✨ Features

- ✅ Read **voltage**, **current**, **temperature**, and **accumulated charge**
- ✅ Enable/disable Coulomb counter with optional deadband
- ✅ Reset charge counter manually
- ✅ Read max/min voltage and current
- ✅ Overwrite min current value (for testing)
- ⚙️ Easy to integrate into any project


##  Installation

### Option 1: Arduino IDE (manual)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the folder to your Arduino libraries directory:
3. Restart the Arduino IDE.

### Option 2: Use the Library Manager
Search for the LTC2959 library in the Arduino Library Manager
###  API Reference

| Function                                   | Return Type | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `begin()`                                  | `bool`      | Initializes I2C and checks if the LTC2959 is present. Returns `true` if successful. |
| `readVoltage()`                            | `float`     | Reads the supply/battery voltage (in volts). |
| `readCurrent()`                            | `float`     | Reads the instantaneous current (in amps). |
| `readTemperature()`                        | `float`     | Reads internal temperature of the chip (in °C). |
| `readCharge_mAh()`                         | `float`     | Reads accumulated charge since last reset (in mAh). |
| `enableCounter(Deadband deadband)`         | `bool`      | Enables the Coulomb counter with a chosen deadband setting. |
| `disableCounter()`                         | `bool`      | Disables the Coulomb counter. |
| `resetChargeCounter()`                     | `void`      | Resets the charge accumulator (ACR) to 0. |
| `readMaxVoltage()`                         | `float`     | Reads the highest recorded voltage since power-up. |
| `readMinVoltage()`                         | `float`     | Reads the lowest recorded voltage since power-up. |
| `readMaxCurrent()`                         | `float`     | Reads the highest recorded current since power-up. |
| `readMinCurrent()`                         | `float`     | Reads the lowest recorded current since power-up. |


###  Requirements

- Arduino-compatible board (e.g., Uno, Mega, ESP32, STM32)
- LTC2959 IC or breakout board
- I2C connection (usually `Wire.begin()` is sufficient)
- External RSENSE resistor (default assumed 0.250 Ω)
- Arduino IDE 1.8+ or Arduino CLI
